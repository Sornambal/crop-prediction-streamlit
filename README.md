# 🌾 Smart Crop Recommendation System

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that intelligently predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on user inputs such as temperature, pH level, rainfall, and more. The system uses a trained Machine Learning model to analyze agricultural data and provide real-time crop recommendations.
